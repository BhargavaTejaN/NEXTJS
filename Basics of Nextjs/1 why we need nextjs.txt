Nextjs is a ReactFramework for the web that is used for building server rendered web applications. 


1) React-Router-Dom Alternative === App Router

we can create all pages using a single folder 
Evey child folder in the app router represents a new page 


2) Creating A Full Stack Application 

we can create our own API using Nextjs 
Create a New Folder api in that we can handle our routs, where as in React We need to use a framework like express.js 


3) Server Side And Client Side Rendering 

we can use server & clinet side components together 
we can fetch data on the server side and improve the SEO of the application and also create client side components to intract with users 
server side like APIS, client side like LOGIN 


4) Optimization 

it uses code splitting to improve the applications initial load time
it splits the bundle of the application into smaller chunks and search them users only when needed
It automatically optimizes the images by compressing them generating multiple sizes for different devices
