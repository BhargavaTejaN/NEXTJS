when we visit any website the server receives a request, 
the server send an empty HTML file and a bunch of bundled js,
our browser process those bundles and renders the final HTML file.

so the initial load speed of an application can be slow because of process
since the page is build on users engines can't index websites properly

but on server side rendering when you vist the website, 
the server recieves the request and renders the HTML and send's the final HTML page to our browser. 
if we have an old phone/computer even it works fine and speed because our browser doesn't need to render from scratch

it shows the initial page faster but since everything happends on server side we won't be able to intract with the user.


if we want to create an event we have to create a client-side component
