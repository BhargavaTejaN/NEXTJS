in src/app folder we can find a file named as layout.js 
This is bascially parent component that is used by other pages, 
what ever we write here it will be applicalbe or appered over all pages

we can ever add our custom layout.jsx pages for all over pages individually

Components Folder 

in Components we can add reusable pages such as NavBar, Footer etc 
such pages we place them in Components folder 
here we no need to specify page.jsx as file name because this is not a page, it's a component 

in layout.js we mention our NavBar and Footer Components
