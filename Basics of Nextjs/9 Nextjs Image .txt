In general if we want to add an image in our application,
we will add image like <img src="" alt="" />

This is how we add image tag in general, but in NEXTJS we don't use This

insted we Add to import <Image /> tag from the NEXTJS as 
import Image from 'next/image'
<Image src="" alt="" />

along with alt and src in NEXTJS we need to add width and height also or else it will throw error 
<Image src="" alt="" width={15} height={15} />

suppose if we want to add image container and add styling to this container 
then instead of width and height adding to image add this to image container 
{
    width : 15px;
    height : 15px;
    position : relative
}
we need to add fill={true} to the image container 
<Image src="" alt="" fill={true} />


other than this we can even use localimages as import 
import Heros from 'public/hero.png'
<Image src={Heros} alt="" />

Normal way is more recemended

Adding external image links in NEXTJS is a bit problamatic 
if we want to add an external images we need to add the domain of that image in configuration file ie next.config.js 

suppose this is the image url 
https://images.pexels.com/photos/17255021/pexels-photo-17255021/free-photo-of-papershoot-camera.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=600&lazy=load

here images.pexels.com is the domain of the image url

const nextConfig = {
    images : {
        domains : [
            "images.pexels.com",
            "timeanddate.com",
            "c.tadst.com"
        ]
    }
}

this is how we need to add external images in NEXTJS
