app/page.js is the Home Page of Nextjs Project
convert the type form js to jsx 

for every page we create the fileName should be only page.jsx 

To create Different Pages we need to create differrnt folders in app Directory/folder 
To create Sub pages for a page, we need to create folders inside that parent folder 

                         login
       dashboard ------> settings                  
app -> about             analytics
       blog

if we want to create a new page named as about --> create a new folder in app and in about folder add a new file page.jsx 

for creating a sub pages inside a parent folder 
like  /blog/blog1. here blog1 is the id, we have some 100 of blogs we can't create manually like we did till now
inside the parent folder create a new folder with square bracket and folder name inside the square bracket[name of subfolder] 

in my case i want to create a page blog page when i click on a perticular blog should be navigated to that subblog page 

app/blog/[id] in [id] folder create a page.jsx file 

supoose if we have authentication pages like login and signup we can group them in a single folder 
using (name) this name won't be considered as a page 
in my case it's (auth)

app/dashboard/(auth)/login
app/dashboard/(auth)/signup
